Lua Repo for sync between Steamdeck and PC.

This repo is intended for personal use.

Note: This depends on layers, found here: https://github.com/Snapster-amb/layers
If you are using this repo, do not assume that the version of layers included here is the latest one.

Need to look into how to properly configure submodules.
